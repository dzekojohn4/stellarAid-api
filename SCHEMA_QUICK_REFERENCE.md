## Key Relationships

### User (Hub)
```
User
├── 1:N Campaigns (created)
├── 1:N Donations (made)
├── 1:N Updates (posted)
├── 1:N Notifications
├── 1:N Disputes (filed)
├── 1:1 Newsletter (subscribed)
└── 1:N AuditLogs
```

### Campaign (Central)
```
Campaign
├── 1:N Donations
├── 1:N Milestones
├── 1:N Updates
└── 1:N Disputes
```

└── References: Donor (User) + Campaign
```

## Critical Constraints

### Unique Fields
| Model | Field(s) | Reason |
|-------|---------|--------|
| User | email | One account per email |
| User | walletAddress | One wallet per user |
| Donation | txHash | One blockchain transaction |
| Donation | (donorId, campaignId, txHash) | Prevent duplicate donations |
| Dispute | donationId | One dispute per donation |
| Newsletter | userId | One subscription per user |
| Newsletter | email | Prevent duplicate subscriptions |

### Cascade Delete Behavior
```
DELETE User → Cascades to: Campaigns, Donations, Updates, Notifications, Disputes, Newsletter
DELETE Campaign → Cascades to: Donations, Milestones, Updates, Disputes
DELETE Donation → Cascades to: Disputes
DELETE User (AuditLog) → Sets to NULL (preserves audit history)
```

---

## Common Query Patterns

### Find User's Donations
```sql
SELECT * FROM donations 
WHERE "donorId" = ? 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;
```

### Find Campaign's Donations
```sql
SELECT * FROM donations 
WHERE "campaignId" = ? 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;
```

### Find Active Campaigns
```sql
SELECT * FROM campaigns 
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE' 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;
```

### Find Campaign Milestones
```sql
SELECT * FROM milestones 
WHERE "campaignId" = ? 
ORDER BY "dueDate" ASC;
```

### Find User Notifications
```sql
SELECT * FROM notifications 
WHERE "userId" = ? AND "isRead" = false 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;
```

### Find Disputes by Status
```sql
SELECT * FROM disputes 
WHERE status = 'OPENED' 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;
```

## Field Types Used

```
UUID (Primary Keys)        - Unique identifiers
String                    - Text fields
Decimal(20, 7)            - Monetary amounts
DateTime                  - Timestamps
Boolean                   - True/false flags
Enum (7 types)            - Status fields
```

---

## Timestamp Fields

Every model includes:
- `createdAt` DateTime @default(now())
- `updatedAt` DateTime @updatedAt

**Except**: AuditLog only has `createdAt` (immutable records)

---

## Index Strategy

### Foreign Key Indices (Auto)
Automatically created on all `@relation` fields for join performance

### Explicit Indices
- Status fields (fast filtering)
- Timestamp fields (chronological queries)
- Search fields (email, category)
- Boolean fields (isActive, isRead, isSubscribed)

## Reserved Words Handling

| Table | Mapping |
|-------|---------|
| update | "updates" (Prisma keyword) |
| audit_logs | Direct mapping (snake_case) |
